# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-ilkhani/">Shay Ilkhani</a>'s Cybersecurity Operations & Adversary Detection Knowledgebase üîê

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Operations & Adversary Detection Knowledgebase ‚Äî a curated collection of research, resources, and technical insights that reflect my dedication to defending modern enterprise environments against today‚Äôs most persistent threats. This repository serves as both a living archive and a practical toolkit, covering a wide range of topics including detection engineering, threat hunting, vulnerability and risk assessments, incident response, and cyber threat intelligence. My work emphasizes not only identifying malicious behaviors aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but also writing actionable detection logic, analyzing adversary tradecraft, and translating technical findings into clear, effective security reports and risk narratives.

With a passion for continuous learning and a mission to bridge operational capability with adversary insight, I aim to share techniques, workflows, and field-proven knowledge that elevate defensive security practices. Whether you're a fellow blue teamer, researcher, or just getting started in cybersecurity, I hope you find value here that helps you detect better, respond faster, and defend smarter.

Please feel free browse any of the below topics and see how the work I‚Äôve put into enhancing security operations and processes can benefit you!
