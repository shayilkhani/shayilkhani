# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shay-ilkhani/">Shay Ilkhani</a>'s Cybersecurity Operations & Adversary Detection Knowledgebase üîê

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Operations & Adversary Detection Knowledgebase ‚Äî a curated collection of research, resources, and technical insights that reflect my dedication to defending modern enterprise environments against today‚Äôs most persistent threats. This repository serves as both a living archive and a practical toolkit, covering a wide range of topics including detection engineering, threat hunting, vulnerability and risk assessments, incident response, and cyber threat intelligence. My work emphasizes not only identifying malicious behaviors aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, but also writing actionable detection logic, analyzing adversary tradecraft, and translating technical findings into clear, effective security reports and risk narratives.

With a passion for continuous learning and a mission to bridge operational capability with adversary insight, I aim to share techniques, workflows, and field-proven knowledge that elevate defensive security practices. Whether you're a fellow blue teamer, researcher, or just getting started in cybersecurity, I hope you find value here that helps you detect better, respond faster, and defend smarter.

Please feel free browse any of the below topics and see how the work I‚Äôve put into enhancing security operations and processes can benefit you!


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Management Experience

- **üîß [Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/shayilkhani/vulnerability-management-program)**  
  Designed a full-scale enterprise vulnerability management program from the ground up, integrating asset classification, CVSS-based risk prioritization, patch lifecycle strategy, and remediation workflows. Aligns with NIST and CIS guidelines to ensure repeatable, policy-driven operations.

- **‚òÅÔ∏è [Cloud to Vulnerability: A Complete Walkthrough of Azure VM Deployment & Enterprise-Grade Scanning with Tenable Nessus](https://github.com/shayilkhani/azure-deployment-and-vulnerability-scanning)**  
  Built and configured Azure-based infrastructure for vulnerability assessment using Tenable Nessus. This project demonstrates the full lifecycle from VM provisioning to scan result interpretation and remediation tracking, offering a clear path from infrastructure to actionable security insight.

- **üîê [Programmatic Cryptographic Vulnerability Remediation Deployment Using PowerShell](https://github.com/shayilkhani/cryptographic-remediation-deployment)**  
  Developed a fully automated PowerShell-based remediation script targeting cryptographic protocol vulnerabilities (e.g., SSL 2.0/3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1, RC4, SWEET32). The script remediates CVEs across SCHANNEL settings and supports secure-by-default configurations for enterprise systems.

## üö® Threat Hunting and Security Operations Experience

- **üß≠ [Threat Hunting Scenario (Tor Browser Usage)](https://github.com/shayilkhani/tor-browser-threat-hunt-scenario)**  
  Simulated a threat hunting investigation centered around unauthorized employee Tor Browser usage to explore evasive user behavior and network anomalies. Includes detection logic, log analysis, and recommended countermeasures based on MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

- **üì© [Microsoft Azure Security Alert Email Investigation Report: Brute Force Attack & Chinese-Based Crypto Mining Operation Breach](https://github.com/shayilkhani/brute-force-breach-report/blob/main/brute-force-breach.pdf)**  
  Conducted a post-incident investigation after receiving a Microsoft Azure security alert email. Utilized Sentinel/MDE telemetry to uncover brute-force attempts and lateral movement leading to illicit crypto mining. Includes incident reconstruction, IoC mapping, and reporting with actionable insights for SOC response teams.


## üß± Security Infrastructure & SOC Engineering Experience

- **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Azure Honeynet SOC with Live Traffic & Incident Reporting](https://github.com/shayilkhani/azure-honey-net-setup)**  
  Built a fully operational Security Operations Center (SOC) in Azure from scratch, including honeynet deployment, custom log connectors, and Microsoft Sentinel integration. The project features LIVE adversary traffic, custom detection rules, workbook for attacker GEO-LOCATION, and a comprehensive incident report. Enables practical infrastructure-as-threat-intelligence with live telemetry, rule tuning, and alert response design.
